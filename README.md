fetching Warren Buffett's shareholder letters.

## Sage of Nebraska

Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathway, each year he will write an annual letter to the shareholders, he will talk about business, investments, and life lessons.
I have been a fan of Warren Buffett and I am fond with his writings. I do this as a python project to scrape the letters back for my own study.
